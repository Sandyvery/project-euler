Project Euler suggests that solutions to their problems should not be shared.
However, the solutions have significant educational value. As such, many blogs and repositories offer solutions in various languages.
We believe that Project Euler is meant to be a challenge, and hence, we offer a chance to learn new programming techniques and optimize your solutions.
The 'game' quality of Project Euler is not of concern to this repository, and those determined to 'cheat' will find a way, regardless.
To avoid 'spoilers', the solutions and answers to each problem are not in plain sight, and require deliberately accessing solution folders and files.
