Project Euler
=============

### About

_A public repository of readable, understandable, efficient solutions to the Project Euler problems._

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of mathematical programming problems, that can be solved through Python programs which execute in under a minute. The use of mathematical concepts and logical thinking leads to the best solutions.

### Contribute

This project runs on [Python 2.7.6](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/).

You can:

- discuss ideas via GitHub comments or email.
- contribute your alternative solutions and improvements via GitHub Pull Requests.
- report bugs via GitHub's Issue Tracker.

Guidelines:

- Keep your code pythonic.
- Read 'template.py' for the solution code format.
- Preferably, avoid the usage of non-default Python modules.
- Reusable functions should be modularized and added to 'customs.py'
- Use the Timer() class, from 'customs.py', to automatically time your solution.
